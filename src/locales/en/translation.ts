The excursion we had to Ourika Valley with the waterfalls and Agafay desert was also an experience we will never forget. Put on your walking shoes, because it is quite a climb to the top. Along the way you will enjoy beautiful views, refreshing river water and the waterfalls themselves are definitely worth it. We also undertook an excursion to Essaouira.
