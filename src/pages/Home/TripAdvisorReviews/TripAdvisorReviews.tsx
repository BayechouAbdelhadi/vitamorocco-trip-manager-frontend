Mohamed\'s wealth of knowledge of the different regions allowed us to easily access the cultural differences of all of the different regions that we were lucky enough to visit. Accommodation each night was brilliant and Mohamed was very flexible and great company. Loved this trip.'

Thanks to a knowledgeable guide, who thought we should experience the city, it was great. That means: taste, see, smell. Experience with all our senses. The excursion we had to Ourika Valley with the waterfalls and Agafay desert was also an experience we will never forget. Put on your walking shoes, because it is quite a climb to the top. Along the way you will enjoy beautiful views, refreshing river water and the waterfalls themselves are definitely worth it. We also undertook an excursion to Essaouira. Wonderful if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.'
