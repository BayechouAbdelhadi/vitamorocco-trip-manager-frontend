                guided tour of Fez. Also known as Fes el Bali, this UNESCO World Heritage Site
                was founded in the 9th century and is home to the world's oldest university.<br/><br/>
                The city of Fez reached its true economic and cultural heyday in the 13th-14th
                centuries under the Merinids when it replaced Marrakech as the kingdom's
                capital. Although the political capital of Morocco was transferred to Rabat in
                1912, Fez has retained its status as the country's craft centre.<br/><br/>
                The artisan workshops in the medina are as active today as they were 100 years ago and
                contribute strongly to the industrial economy of the city. Trades such as
                blacksmithing, leather goods, ceramics, silk, tapestries and sculpture are still
                practiced in these workshops today.<br/><br/>
                The original walls still protect this ancient
                city and its approximately 9,000 narrow passageways and bustling streets.
                On this guided tour of Fez, you will visit the following attractions:
                • Jewish mellah
                • The tannery
                • Souk of silk, wool and cotton dyers
                • Zellij Ceramic and Tile Cooperative
                • Al Quaraouiyine University.
                • Royal Palace of Fes
                • Weavers Cooperative
                • The panoramic view of Fez el Bali.
                At the end of the city tour, you will have free time to continue exploring the city
                by yourself, then we will spend our second night in the Medina of Fez.`
